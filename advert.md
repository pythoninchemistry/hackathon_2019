# pythoninchemistry Hackathon

We are excited to announce the first pythoninchemsitry hackathon event will take place at the Univerty of Bath Department of Chemistry on the 8th April 2020. 
The aim of this event is to develop interactive teaching tools for use by undergraduate chemistry students. 
We want to bring together experts in education, experts in programming, and students, and to dedicate time to the development of tools that use Python and the Jupyter Notebook framework to allow students of chemistry to interact with practical examples, where the code is fully comprehensible. 

The event will begin at 10am and run until 4pm, with lunch provided. 
Additionally, there is some funding to support student attendence.
